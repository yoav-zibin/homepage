All dispatching benchmarks in <A href="COU-dispatching-benchmarks.zip">COU</A>/<A href="COMPACT-dispatching-benchmarks.zip">COMPACT</A> format,
click <A href="benchmarks-format.html">here</A> for format explanations<br>


The constraints on all formats are:
<OL>
<li>The hierarchy has a single root.
<li>Types are given in a topological order.
<LI>NO transitive edges, i.e., we only write the direct parents of each type.
<li>Method families are always of size greater than 1 (no degenerate method families).
<li>NO Ambiguities! We assumed method families are 
  augmented with ambiguity resolvers.   
</OL>

<h3>Concerning Multiple-Dispatching</h3>
The best known multi-dispatching techniques (good test time, and reasonable space requirements) are called:
	<A href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/330853.html">
	<b>S</b>ingle <b>R</b>eciever <b>P</b>rojections (SRP)</A> 
	and
	<A href="http://www.acm.org/pubs/citations/proceedings/oops/191080/p244-amiel/#abstract">
	<b>C</b>ompressed <b>N</b>-dimensional dispatch <b>T</b>ables (CNT)</A>
	(also <A href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/reports/abstracts/TR2001-404/">here</A>,
	and <A href="http://www.acm.org/pubs/citations/journals/toplas/1998-20-1/p116-dujardin/">here</A>).<br>
They are both based on the idea of reducing a dispatch of a multi-method of arity <i>k</i>
	to <i>k</i> single dispatching.
In CNT the results of these <i>k</i> dispatching are indices used to access a 
	<i>k</i>-dimensional table (storing method addresses).
In SRP the results are bitvectors; 
	we then <i>AND</i> the bitvectors, find the index of the leftmost ON bit,
	which is then used to access an array of method addresses.
<br>

In the zip file containing all benchmarks, 
you'll find the single dispatching projection of the multi-methods
(which is simply replacing a multi-method of arity <i>k</i> by <i>k</i> mono-methods).
I removed families with a single member, and also arguments which never change.<br>


<h3>The benchmarks</h3>
<UL>
	<li>
		Single-Dispatching.<br>
		By <A href="mailto:karel@cs.mcgill.ca">Karel Driesen</A><br>
		Taken from:
			<A href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/oocsb/classheterarchies/">oocsb</A>
		(The original suffixe was *.cou)<br>

		Used in the article
			<A href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/oocsb/papers/TRCS95-05.html">Minimizing Row Displacement Dispatch Tables</A>
			in OOPSLA 95<br>
		
		<br>
		Problems with the benchmarks:<br>
		1) java.inh4: static functions and constructors were added.<br>
		2) v1-* are small benchamrks extracted from visualworks (Parcplace Smalltalk).<br>
		3) visualworks2 have lines which are cut in the middle; we fixed it.<br>
		4) In the following hierarchies, some types implement the same message more than once:
		visualage2.kern (171), visualage2.all (207), nextstep (1), et(1), 
		unidraw-interviews (163), geode (12).<br>
		5) I removed families with a single member; 
			In visualage2.all there were 10875 removed families.<br>
		6) When calculating the average number of parents, one need to perform transitive reduction.
			That wasn't done by Driesen et al.<br>
		7) I always added a root when the hierarchy had several roots.<br>
		8) I added extra methods to resolve ambiguities:
			lov-object-editor (97), geode (444), self-system (1).<br>
		As a result the statistics on those benchmark slightly vary from those found in the article,
		and in the files themselves.<br>
