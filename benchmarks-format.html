The format include the <i>type-hierarchy</i> structure, i.e.,
	the name of types and the inheritance links connecting them.
The dispatching benchmarks also include the names of <i>messages</i>.
A message is the unique identifier for a set of types 
	which declared a <i>method implementation</i> for that message.
This set of types is called a <i>method family</i>.
